# Exercise 3

We will solve the same problem as the previous Exercise but this time we shall use dictionaries.
The problem is to count the frequency of each word in a sentence. Ignoring the case.
For example the sentence
```
'Ba ba black sheep'
```
Should give the output -
```
ba 2
black 1
sheep 1
```

> NOTE:
>
> In this code you will require only one loop and one dictionary. The following string methods will still prove useful -
> * string - `split()` , `lower()`
>
> Use `dir()` and `help()` to understand the usage of the methods
