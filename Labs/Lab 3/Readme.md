## Dictionaries

You have been given two lists -
```python
names = ['melon', 'mango', 'banana', 'apple']
costs = [1.29, 2.55, 0.79, 1.49]
```

1. Create a dictionary with the `names` as the keys and the `costs` as the values. (Try to use the `zip()` and create the dictionary in a single line of code.)
2. Add a new element to the dictionary - `'kiwi': 3.19`.
3. Remove a key from the dictionary - `'mango'`.
4. Check if a key called `'strawberry'` exists in the dictionary.
5. Check if a value `2.55` exists in the dictionary.

## Sets
1. Construct a set out of the list `[2,3,5,7,11,13]`.
2. Construct a set out of the letters of the string - `'python'`.
3. How would check if ‘silent’ is an anagram of ‘listen’ ? (Hint: Loops are not required. One line of code should be sufficient)
4. Find the number of unique letters in the word ‘mississippi’ ? (Hint: One line of code should be sufficient here as well)

## Files and Lists
Given a list -
```python
names = ['melon', 'mango', 'banana', 'apple']
```
Print each element on a separate line in file called 'names.txt'. Do this using while loop.
